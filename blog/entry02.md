# Hello world

##### My first react application

I created my first hello world application a while back using react, I just haven't uploaded it to the blog.
It is located under the repository "HelloWorld" and I used the demo app along with the simplified demo app linked on the 
course page to get it going. Given that both javascript and react were new to me I had issues at first, but I feel like I've gotten the hang
of it now.

##### Ideas for my project

I am planning on creating a memory game as my project, I have started it and have made some progress, not a lot though.
I'm hoping for the bigger parts of the game design to be done by friday this week, then implement the functionality over the weekend.
