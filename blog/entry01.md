### About me
My name is Carl Pagels, I'm 22 years old and I study Software Technology at Linnaeus University, Växjö.


### Web development experience
I don't have a lot of experience developing web applications, I have taken one course in PHP and done some experimenting on my own but that's about as far as my experience goes for now. I have barely used JavaScript before.


### Tools
I use Sublime Text for most of my coding, I do have some extensions installed to improve the editor, and I use Google Chrome and firefox as my main browsers.
